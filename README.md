## Overview

This README file explains The Med-trix project.

WELCOME! Weâ€™re so excited to work with you and collaborate on something amazing. 

## What is this project?

The goal of this project is to access healthcare in Nigeria speedily. Before now, this can be very difficult and painstaking. Quite absurd being that the first thing to living is being healthy. Med-trix is a simple tool that aims to help any user find, export, and share hospitals within their region. 


### How does it work?

As a user, you will sign up with your Email and password or with a Google account. When logged in, you can find hospitals within your state by typing your state on the search box in "Find Care page'. Once you see your choice hospital, you can download the list via csv file-type by clicking the download button. You can also copy the link of the list. This App is intuitive and easy to navigate even as a first user.
